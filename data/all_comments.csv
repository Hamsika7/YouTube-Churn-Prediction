V9zWygHc18M,"So much can be said about this game! But Barca players resurrection In Flick&#39;s team is incredible. Beside Lewa, Yamal, and Rapha, Ferran Torres is now a super sub who does it every game. Pedri is a master mind in the field, even Martinez has improved. Also Hansi&#39; celebrating like a child after the 3rd and 4th game tells you how Barca&#39;s mentality is.",0.9642

W1KmmQ3PJmA,"This honestly kinda sucks. It feels like were only going to get a few more videos with ty and the bunco ladies, because shawna literally cant find a spot where she will fit comfortably within the dynamic, especially considering there is someone in the group who apparently hates her guts. I guess we might be looking at a new chapter, because i would not keep trying to stay in a place where i have some friends but im constantly on edge with the one person who can&#39;t stand me. I think a lot of friendships might have just ended in this video üò¢<br><br>Or Julie might have a come to Jesus moment and actually try a little better communication with Shawna so they can be amicable I mean FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE Shawna drove you to the hospital when your water broke, she didn&#39;t HAVE to do that. God knows Julie would not have if the roles were reversed, and if Julie seriously continues to treat Shawna like something she stepped in after this, I will have no more patience for her, I&#39;m hanging on by a thread as it is. Honestly, as a mom myself, I would be so disappointed in my daughter if I found out she was treating someone like that for no reason.",0.8463
W1KmmQ3PJmA,"Brilliant. Love the Shawna growth and realization, but when I tell you I was most proud when she called Julie out for straight up lying to her friend group with the &quot;we&#39;ve met a bunch of times&quot; and then a little extra cathartic healing with Alicia telling her to stop being a twat. Just chef&#39;s kiss. I needed that. You have the freedom to say and act how you want but you are not free from the consequences of those actions.",0.8731

The PURPOSE of My WORK is to DEFEAT SATAN, to SHOW MY WISDOM and ETERNAL POWER, to EXPOSE ALL THE DECEPTIONS OF SATAN, and THEREFORE TO SAVE THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE, WHO LIVE UNDER ITS COVERAGE. üôèüî¥<br>This is to SHOW My WISDOM and infinite power while REVEALING the unbearable awfulness of Satan. üî¥<br>Even more, it is to TEACH My CREATIONS to lean BETWEEN GOOD and EVIL, to KNOW that I am the RULER of ALL THINGS, to SEE CLEARLY that SATAN is the ENEMY OF HUMANITY, the LOWEST of the low, the He is BAD, and to SEE, whenthere is DEFINITELY no--absolutely, the DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD and EVIL, TRUTH and LIES, HOLY and DEFECT, and WHAT is GREAT and WHAT is LOW. üôèüåª<br>IN THIS WAY, ignorant humanity CAN BE MY WITNESS that I AM NOT THE ENDORSEMENT, and ONLY I----the LORD of creation---can SAVE mankind, can GIVE MAN the THINGS that They will ENJOY, and they will KNOWI am the RULER of all things, and SATAN is just ONE of My CREATIONS and LATER RESISTS Me. üåª<br>My six--thousand--year GOVERNMENT PLAN IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PHASES to ACHIEVE the FOLLOWING RESULTS: to ALLOW My CREATIONS to be My WITNESSES, to KNOW My WILL, to SEE Me the TRUTH. üôè<br><br>So, DURING THE FIRST PHASE OF WORK in My six--thousand--year REIGN PLAN, I did the WORK of the LAW, which is the WORK by which JEHOVAH LEADS HIS PEOPLE. üôè<br>THE SECOND PHASE BEGINS THE WORK OF THE AGE OF GRACE IN THE VILLAGES OF JUDEA. JESUS ‚Äã‚ÄãREPRESENTS ALL THE WORKS of the Age of Grace; He became MAN and was CRUCIFIED, and He also inaugurated the Age of Grace. He was CRUCIFIED to FINISH the WORK of REDEMPTION, to END the AGE of LAW and BEGIN the AGE of GRACE, and so He is CALLED the &quot;Supreme--high Ruler&quot;, the &quot;Sin Offering&quot;, the &quot;Redeemer&quot; &quot;. üôè<br>So Jehovah&#39;s work, even though they are the SAME in PRINCIPLE. Jehovah began the AGE OF LAW, ESTABLISHED the headquarters, that is, the place of ORIGIN, of His WORK on EARTH, and ISSUED the commandments; these are TWO of His FULFILLMENTS, which REPRESENT the AGE of the LAW. üôè<br>The work that Jesus accomplished in the Age of Grace was not to issue COMMANDMENTS, BUT to FULFILL the COMMANDMENTS, thus ushering in the Age of Grace and ending the Age of Law that lasted for two thousand years. He is the DISCOVERER, who CAME to START the AGE of GRACE, but REDEMPTION is the main part of His work. Therefore His accomplishments also have two parts; the OPENING of a new age, and the completion of the work of redemption by His crucifixion. And He went away. At this point, the Age of Law came to an end and humanity entered the Age of Grace. üôè<br><br><br>¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† &quot;The Real History Behind Work in the Age of Redemption&quot;<br>Fulfillment of (Ezekiel 2:9-10) and (Revelation 18:9,13)<br><br>¬†¬† ¬†¬† The &quot;Savior&quot; came already in 1991 like a thief, so He prepared us then to be like those waiting for the return of his Lord so that when he comes and &quot;knocks&quot; we can immediately open the door. He came to &quot;save&quot; us by purifying with His Word the kingdom He brought down to earth with His holy name and His totality engraved on, &quot;THE CHURCH OF ALMIGHTY GOD&quot; üíê This is the fulfillment of &quot;The Letter to the Church of Philadelphia&quot; (Revelation 3:12)&quot;The one who overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will not be removed from it forever. I will engrave on him the NAME of my God, and the name of the CITY of my God, the NEW JERUSALEM that will come down from HEAVEN to My God. I will also engrave my NEW NAME on him.&quot; ... And in (Matthew 16:18-19) &quot;And I say to you, you are Peter, and UNDER this rock I will BUILD my CHURCH, and not the power of death will prevail over him. I will give YOU the KEY to the kingdom of heaven: what you forbid on earth you will forbid in heaven and what you allow on earth it will be allowed in heaven.&quot; ... The fulfillment of His return is everything recorded in the great book of Revelation (such as these important ones, The Seals, The Bowls of God&#39;s Wrath, The Millennium, and The New Heavens and New Earth.) This is the beginning of A Thousand Years of Gathering Spirits that have becomeperfect because of His Word, and the beginning of the 144,000 (Revelation 14:3-4) &quot;The Song of the Redeemed&quot;) from the twelve tribes of Israel who faithfully serve the Lamb, the first offerings until the number of 200,000,000 became perfect. (Revelation 6:10-11 and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9p9_GrPqAY&amp;t=556"">9:16</a> &quot;The Seals&quot;). ... Because the Lamb in the middle of the THRONE will be their PASTOR .... (Revelation 7:17)üíê<br><br>‚¨áÔ∏è<br>The recorded prophecy is below! <br>(Exodus 20:1/ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9p9_GrPqAY&amp;t=1222"">20:22</a>/ 21:1/ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9p9_GrPqAY&amp;t=1272"">21:12</a> ...)<br>&quot;This is the beginning of the Age of Law&quot; the first phase of God&#39;s work the first station. (The book of the Old Testament)<br>--- The Ten Commandments<br>--- The Commandments about altars<br>--- The Slave Law<br>--- Laws about Violence ... <br><br>‚¨áÔ∏è<br>(Luke 1:31)<br>&quot;This is the coming of the Age of Grace (also called the Age of Redemption). The second period recorded in the New Testament. <br>&quot;Listen! You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will call him Jesus. <br>He will be great, and WILL BE CALLED SON OF THE HIGHEST. The Lord God will give him the throne of His father David.&quot;<br>‚¨áÔ∏è<br>(Matthew 5:17) The Teaching about the Law<br>&quot;DO NOT THINK THAT I HAVE COME TO AVOID THE LAW AND THE TEACHING OF THE PROPHETS. I HAVE COME, NOT TO AVOID---BUT TO EXPLAIN AND PERFECT THEM.&quot;¬† ‚¨ÖÔ∏è<br>‚¨áÔ∏è<br>(John 19:17) Jesus was crucified",0.9989

This change would make a big difference to the game, and it would be MUCH MORE CREATIVE and INTERESTING. What about getting fouled?

As it should be, based on degree of difficulty and merit. Of course, you COULD hit a 2.5, get fouled, and make the free throw for 3.5 points... That is fair. Making a tougher shot while being fouled should yield a slight bit more.<br><br>NBA, please make this change. Instead of the trey, it becomes &#39;the point 5&#39;.

3G5kjStPdP0,"As someone with some educational background in data analytics and a certificate in data analytics and data analytical programming, the numbers never lie. However, the stories we translate from them can, because all of that is up to human interpretation. There is always some new statistic, some new metric, or something quantitative and qualitative we can derive to find value. I have not deep dived the analytics of basketball, but this video showcased some causation and correlation on data that ties Jimmy Butler being a team with enhanced performance.<br><br>The issue with analytics in sports will always be that some of these values are understated, people interpret things wrong, and there is no set value for every analytic that applies the exact same way to every organization, team, 5-man squad or rotation, player, or even game or possession. Data analytics and science, like analysis based on understanding of basketball, has so much nuisance that it requires constant evaluation.<br><br>Organizations that constantly look at data analytics and understanding of fundamentals of basketball and constantly analyze it with the skills, expertise and history in them are paramount, but secretly just as paramount is constantly expanding yourself and looking for constant growth and viewpoints that are different from your own. In the end, it is all truly not unlike anything in learning, business or personal growth.",0.864
